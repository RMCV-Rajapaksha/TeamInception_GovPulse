to start the server for development purposes use following,

```
npx prisma generate # see the Note
npm run dev
```

to start the server for production environment use following

```
npx prisma generate # see the Note
npm start
```

# Note

you dont need to run the npx prisma generate everytime. Just after cloning the repo and after making and saving changes to /prisma/schema.prisma are instances when you'd need to execute this command
