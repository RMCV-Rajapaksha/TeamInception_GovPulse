## Automated Scheduling

- **Timezone**: Asia/Colombo (Sri Lankan time)
- **Logic**: Finds appointments 24 hours away and sends reminders
- **Prevents Duplicates**: Ensures only one reminder per appointment

### Error Handling:
- Email failures don't affect core appointment functionality
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data

## Configuration

### Email Service Configuration:
Currently configured for Gmail, but can be adapted for other providers:

```javascript
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: "gmail", // Change this for other providers
  auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS, // Use app-specific password for Gmail
  },
});
```

### Cron Job Configuration:
```javascript
// Run every hour
cron.schedule('0 * * * *', async () => {
  await this.checkAndSendReminders();
});
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Email Credentials**: Stored in environment variables
2. **Authentication**: All official endpoints require valid tokens
3. **Authorization**: Officials can only update their authority's appointments
4. **Data Validation**: All inputs are validated before processing

## Monitoring and Logging

The system includes comprehensive logging:
- ‚úÖ Successful email deliveries
- ‚ùå Email failures with error details
- üîç Reminder checking activities
- üìß Email sending attempts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Emails not sending**:
   - Check EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS environment variables
   - Verify Gmail app-specific password
   - Check console logs for specific errors

2. **Reminders not being sent**:
   - Verify cron job is running
   - Check appointment dates are in the future
   - Review timezone settings

3. **HTML formatting issues**:
   - Test emails in different email clients
   - Verify HTML template syntax

### Testing:

You can test the system by:
1. Booking test appointments
2. Checking console logs for email confirmations
3. Verifying email delivery in recipient inboxes
4. Testing different update types from official panel

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
1. SMS notifications integration
2. Email delivery tracking
3. User email preferences
4. Template customization per authority
5. Multi-language support
6. Push notifications for mobile app
